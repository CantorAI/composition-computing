# Annotations

Annotation refers to **labeling data** to train algorithms. For example

- Labeling photos of objects, such as, cats and dogs.
- Tagging parts of speech in a sentence.
- Highlighting spam in emails.
- Marking bounding boxes around objects in videos.

Annotations are needed in large-scale machine learning tasks, especially: 

**Supervised Learning** – Most ML models learn from labeled (annotated) data.

**Accuracy & Performance** – Better annotations → better training → better model results.

**Bias Reduction** – Well-annotated, diverse data helps models make fairer predictions.

**Interpretability** – Annotated examples help humans understand what models are learning.

In CantorAI Design Studio, we provide a few key annotation functions: 

## Image Annotations

## Automatic Annotations

Also, there are several tools for annotations.
