## Examples

### Getting Started

With this example, you will be able to login to CantorAI Design Studio for the first time and enter the gate of the world of CantorAI's composition computing platform. 

##### Concepts:

- `**CantorAI Design Studio**: It is a front-end tool designed to 

  - ease most of your configurations of your composition computing network with simple mouse clicks and a few keystrokes,

  - visualize your network assets and their organization, 

  - help to construct your apps with a visualized pipeline building mechanism,

  - customize dashboard and monitor systemetic, applicational  matrics

  - customize the 

  However, CantorAI Design studio should not be regarded as a all-in-one venue to conduct all the development. We do assume its user has reasonable knowledge how CantorAI technology works.

### Annotations

Annotation refers to **labeling data** to train algorithms. For example:

- Labeling photos of cats and dogs.
- Tagging parts of speech in a sentence.
- Highlighting spam in emails.
- Marking bounding boxes around objects in videos.

Annotations are needed in large-scale machine learning tasks, especially: 

**Supervised Learning** – Most ML models learn from labeled (annotated) data.

**Accuracy & Performance** – Better annotations → better training → better model results.

**Bias Reduction** – Well-annotated, diverse data helps models make fairer predictions.

**Interpretability** – Annotated examples help humans understand what models are learning.

In CantorAI Design Studio, we provide a few key annotation functions: 

Image Annotations

Automatic Annotations

Also, there are several tools for annotations.
